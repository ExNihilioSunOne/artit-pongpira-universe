# ERA I: FOUNDATIONS (2000-2015)

## The Beginning of the Journey
This era contains my earliest observations of mathematical patterns in nature.

### Key Themes:
1. Fibonacci sequences in Thai plants
2. Golden ratio in temple architecture
3. Early number theory explorations
4. Prime number patterns in rainfall data

### First Conjectures:
- "Nature counts in spirals" (2003)
- "Primes appear where growth pauses" (2008)
- "The universe has a mathematical heartbeat" (2012)

### Files to Add:
- [ ] Nature observation journals
- [ ] Early sketchbooks
- [ ] First equation attempts
